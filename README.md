# Javascript CA 1
A site showing top free pc games and a contact page.

# Description
This is a Javascript Course Assignment i had for school, in wich i created a website that fetches all its content from an API to show the Top free games to play for PC.
On this site ive created a layout that is easy to navigate and also there color schemes pop out to make the website stand out.
There is also a contact page in wich the user must input correct number of letters and a email into the contact submit form.
